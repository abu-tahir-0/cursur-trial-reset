# Cursor Device Fingerprint Reset

Too many free trial accounts used on this machine. Please upgrade to pro fix.


## Prerequisites

- Windows operating system
- Administrative privileges

## Important Disclaimer

This solution should only be used in the following legitimate scenarios:

1. During Cursor's official free trial period
2. When the system mistakenly flags as duplicate trial due to technical issues
3. As a temporary solution when official support is not readily available
4. After a clean Windows reinstall that triggered false duplicate detection
5. When hardware changes cause incorrect device identification
6. For development/testing environments with proper licensing

**Note:** This is not intended to bypass licensing. Please ensure you have a valid license or are within the official trial period. For permanent solutions, we recommend:
- Purchasing a Cursor Pro license
- Contacting official Cursor support
- Clearing browser data and cache first
- Verifying your account status in Cursor settings
